# JavaScript

1. First Step is to get your API Keys from your dashboard.

![Keys](/_static/keys.png)

> For security reasons, We do not store your tokens (not even encrypted !). You'll have to generate a new token if you lose this.
> You can generate as many tokens as you want.

Why API Key is required? Find [here]().

2. Head to your main `index.html` file and inside the `<head>` tag.

Add this script to your head tag -

```js
<script
  defer
  src="https://scripts.vedanalytics.in/bundle.js"
  data-project="YOUR_PROJECT_ID"
  data-api-key="YOUR_API_KEY"
></script>
```

> NOTE - You can get your project-id from your dashboard.
