# React

1. First Step is to get your API Keys from your dashboard.

> For security reasons, We do not store your tokens (not even encrypted !). You'll have to generate a new token if you lose this.
> You can generate as many tokens as you want.

Why API Key? Find [here](/WhyAPI).

2. Download the Ved Analytics Client component from the registry.

```bash
npm i ved-analytics
```

3. Import the component in the main `index.js` file -

```jsx
import VedAnalytics from 'ved-analytics';

const project = process.env.VED_PROJECT_ID;
const apiKey = process.env.VED_API_KEY;

const root = ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById('root'));
root.render(
  <React.StrictMode>
    <VedAnalytics project={project} apiKey={apiKey} />
    <App />
  </React.StrictMode>
);

reportWebVitals();
```

> NOTE - You can get your project-id from your dashboard.

4. It is recommended to store the API-KEY and ProjectID in a `.env` file and use it in your component.

```env
VED_PROJECT_ID=
VED_API_KEY=
```

5. You are good to go !
