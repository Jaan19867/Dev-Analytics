# Location

Again taking the privacy rout, we decided not to track locations of users not by their IP Addresses. Usually the location of the users is stored in the browwsers.

It is of IANA format. We assume the Browser's location as the location of the user and use that to display the country data.

That data is taken from the offical codes and used to display the Country Data.
